### Reverse Integer
**Pop and Push Digits & Check before Overflow**
- [source code](source/popPush.py)

```python
class Solution:
    def reverse(self, x: int) -> int:
        # set return value 
        # set a flag for checking negative number 
        # if the arguement is a negative number 
            # set the flag as true 
            # modify the arguement to positive number 
        # iterate until the arguement is depleted 
            # push the number from right to left  
            # reduce the number from left to right        
        # if the number is out side the scope of the integer 
            # return zero 
        # if the original argument was negative 
            # covert the return value back to negative number 
        # return the result
```
