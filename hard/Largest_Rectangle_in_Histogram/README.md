### Largest Rectangle in Histogram
**Stack**
- [Source code](source/Stack.py)
```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, height):
        # height append 0 in case there is no input
        # create a stack with -1 to calculate the area for first rectangle  
        # set the returning answer
        # iterate the input
            # if the current height is smaller than the head of the stack
                # get the height
                # get the width
                # record the maximum area
            # add the height
        # return the largest area
        pass
```
