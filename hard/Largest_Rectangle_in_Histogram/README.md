- [Source code](source/Stack.py)
```python
class Solution:
    def largestRectangleArea(self, height):
        # height append 0 in case there is no input
        # set a stack that will never be empty
        # set the returning answer
        # iterate the input
            # if the current height is smaller than the head of the stack
                # get the hieght
                # get the widith
                # record the maximum area
            # add the height
        # return the largest area
        pass
```
