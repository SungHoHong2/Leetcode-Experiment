### Add Two Numbers

- [source code](source/carry.py)
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def addTwoNumbers(self, l1: ListNode, l2: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # create return array
        # pointer that will be used for the iteration
        # initialize the carry
        # iterate until either l1 and l2 are empty
            # initialize x, y
            # if l1 is not empty assign x as l1.val
            # if l2 is not empty assign y as l2.val
            # get the sum value
            # get the carry value for the next iteration
            # add the answer
            # move on to next iteration
        # send the carry value to the next node just in case this is the end of the iteration
        # return the result without the dummy head
```
