```python
class Solution:
    def nextPermutation(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        # find the item that has the ascending order 
        # if the pivot that has the ascending order is found 
            # find the smallest item that is from the right side of the pivot
            # swap the next larger number number with the pivot 
        # reverse all the items in the right side of the pivot
        pass 

    def swap(self, nums, i, j):
        pass 

    def reverse(self, nums, start):
        pass
```
