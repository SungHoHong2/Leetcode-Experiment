**Sentinel**
- [Source code](source/Sentinel.py)
```python
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def plusOne(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        # create the sentinel head 
        # find the rightmost not-nine digit 
        # increase this rightmost not-nine digit by 1 if the not_nine is found 
        # increase the sentinel by 1 if the not-nine digit is not found
        # set all the following nines to zeros 
        # return the whole linked-list if the sentinel is updated or return without the sentinel
        pass
