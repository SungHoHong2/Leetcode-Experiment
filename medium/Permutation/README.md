### Permutations
**Backtracking**
- [Concepts](images/backtracking.png)
- [Source code](source/backtracking.py)
```python
class Solution:
    def permute(self, nums):
        # set the return output
        # invoke recursion and start from swapping with the first index
        pass

    def backtrack(self, first, nums, n):
        # append the result  if all indexes are used for swapping 
        # iterate all the indexes that can be swapped with the selected index 
            # swap the index with the selected index 
            # invoke the next recursion with the using the next index 
            # recover the swapped array to its original state 
        pass
```
