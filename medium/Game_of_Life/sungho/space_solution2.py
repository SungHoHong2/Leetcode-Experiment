# 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.
# 2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
# 3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by over-population..
# 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.
# perform simultaneous updation as is required in the question

# -1 means the cell was live before but now dead.
# 2 means the cell was dead before but now live.
