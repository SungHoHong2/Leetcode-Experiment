**Stack**
- [Source code](source/Stack.py)
```python
class Solution:
    def asteroidCollision(self, asteroids: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # create a stack for collecting the remaining asteroids
        # iterate the asteroids  
            # set the flag for checking collision 
            # when the left and right asteroids collide e                         
                # if the left asteroid is destroyed
                # if the right asteroid is destroyed 
                # if both asteroids are destroyed
            # add a new asteroid in the stack if there is no collision
        # return the stack
        pass
