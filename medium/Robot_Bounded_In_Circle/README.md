    - the limit cycle trajectory
        - After at most 4 cycles, the limit cycle trajectory returns to the initial point. 
        1. If the robot returns to the initial point after one cycle, that's the limit cycle trajectory.
        2. If the robot doesn't face north at the end of the first cycle, that's the limit cycle trajectory.
