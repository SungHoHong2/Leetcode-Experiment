```python
class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # The length of the input array
        # The left and right arrays
        # Aggregate the products from the left
            # track the history of the aggregated product until one element is left in the nums array
        # Aggregate the products from the left
            # track the history of the aggregated product until one element is left in the nums array
        # Calculate the product that excludes the original element in the nums array
            # calculate the products of the left and the right calculation
        # return the answer
