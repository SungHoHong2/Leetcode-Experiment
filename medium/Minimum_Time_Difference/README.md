- [Source code](source/accumulate.py)
```python
class Solution:
    def findMinDifference(self, timePoints: List[str]) -> int:
        # sort the timepoints according to the total accumulated minutes
        # append the first timepoint that starts after 24 hours
        # compare the difference of intervals of timepoints
        pass
```
